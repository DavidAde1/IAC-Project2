# INTRODUCTION
### Hello everyone and welcome to the part 2 of my IAC-Project,you can checkout [here](https://github.com/DavidAde1/IAC-Project1) for part 1 to take a read.
## The objective of this project is simple but a little bit advanced: Provisioning a load balancer to our AWS infrastructure and exposing a simple HTML page that specify the hostname of the instance responding in our infrastructure. We will also make use of ASG(Auto Scaling Group) and instance template in this project. Do not panic,we've got this under control.
